    <h1>The Benefits of yoga.</h1>
    <h3> Improve hip movement </h3>
    <p>Hip hinge movement is the pattern
      of flexion and extension throughout
      the hip joint. Especially important for
      runners, hikers and people who enjoy kettle
      bell workouts, proper hip hinge movement lessens
      the chance of athletic injury by decreasing
      stress on the joint. Because yoga places such
      a stringent focus on knee, ankle, hip and sacrum
      alignment during static poses, it helps to strengthen
      and loosen the hip joints while also promoting healthy hip
      hinge movement that carries over into many activities.</p>
      <h3>Improves bones and Muscles</h3>
      <p>Practicing yoga on a regular basis improves the health
        of your bones while strengthening your spine and muscles.
        It also works the tendons and ligaments, making them less
        susceptible to breakdown. And, of course, yoga improves your
        flexibility. These yoga benefits work together to protect your
        body from injury.</p>
        <h3>  Protects your spine</h3>
        <p> Spinal disks—the shock
          absorbers between the vertebrae that can herniate and compress nerves—crave
          movement. That's the only way they get their nutrients. If you've got a
          well-balanced asana practice with plenty of backbends, forward bends, and twists,
          you'll help keep your disks supple.</p>
